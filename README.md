Overview
The Pet Care System is a Java-based application designed to manage and streamline various aspects of pet care using advanced data structures and algorithms. This project focuses on implementing efficient solutions through the use of a Doubly Linked List and Graph data structures.

Features
Pet Management: Efficiently add, remove, and manage pet information using a Doubly Linked List.
Route Optimization: Utilize Graph algorithms to determine the best routes for pet care services, such as grooming and veterinary visits.
Data Integrity: Ensure consistent and reliable data handling through robust algorithm implementations.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Data Structures: Doubly Linked List, Graph


Objectives
Demonstrate the practical application of data structures in solving real-world problems.
Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing pet care activities.
Optimize operational tasks within the pet care system through efficient algorithm design.
